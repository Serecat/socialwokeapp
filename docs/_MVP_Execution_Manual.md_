# Execution Manual for Social Media Platform MVP

---

## MODULE 0 – Orientation

### What this project is:
This project is a free-speech-oriented social media platform for adults, with a focus on chronological feeds, real-time communication, and user privacy. The platform leverages real identities while respecting GDPR compliance and ensuring strong security.

### What the final MVP will do:
- **Core functionality**:
  - Account creation (email/password, real names, public/private profiles).
  - Like/Comment on posts.
  - Chronological feeds:
    - Follower Feed (users can see posts by followed accounts).
    - Exploration Feed (based on user interests).
  - 1:1 direct messaging between users.
  - Admin moderation tools for banning/removing posts.
- **Technical foundation**: 
  - Secure, stateless backend architecture.
  - Scalable frontend connected to backend APIs.
  - PostgreSQL for data storage and Redis for real-time communication.

### What is explicitly out of scope:
- Media uploads (e.g., images, videos).
- Notifications.
- Advanced interaction features like threaded comments/group chats.
- Post-MVP extensibility such as dating modules, games, or public APIs.

### How to use this manual:
- Follow each module in order. 
- Complete all steps and verification checklists before moving forward.
- If a task or feature is labeled “Post-MVP,” skip it for now unless explicitly revisited later.

## MODULE 1 – Environment & Tooling Setup

### Tools, Versions, and Accounts Needed:
1. **Required tools**:
   - Node.js: v18.x
   - TypeScript: v5.x
   - PostgreSQL: v15.x
   - Redis: v7.x
   - Git
   - Docker (optional, for testing isolated environments).
2. **Accounts to create** (if not already available):
   - GitHub (for code repository and CI/CD pipelines).
   - Hosting accounts (e.g., Render, Railway, or Fly.io).

### What to install:
1. Install Node.js and npm.
2. Install TypeScript globally: `npm install -g typescript`.
3. Install PostgreSQL and set up a local database instance.
4. Install Redis and run locally or use a managed Redis instance.
5. Install Git and clone the project repository.

### What folders/files should exist at the end:
- Project folder (from the Git repository).
- Subfolders:
  - `/src`: Main source code.
  - `/config`: Configuration files for different environments.
  - `/docs`: Documentation (PRD and other reference docs).

### Verification checklist:
- Verify Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and Redis installations by checking versions:
  - `node -v`
  - `tsc -v`
  - `psql --version`
  - `redis-cli --version`
- Ensure you can connect to both Redis and PostgreSQL locally.

## MODULE 2 – System Architecture (Conceptual)

### High-level system overview:
The platform uses a **modular monolith** architecture with the following components:
1. **Frontend**: React app for user interaction using REST APIs.
2. **Backend**: NestJS backend for API handling, authentication, and business logic.
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data storage.
4. **Real-time components**: Redis for real-time chat and scalable event handling.

### Why this architecture was chosen:
- **Simplicity**: Minimizes deployment complexity while enabling scalability.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extendable for post-MVP features like dating modules and games.
- **Performance**: Redis enables fast real-time messaging.

### What not to change at this stage:
- No microservices (the MVP focuses on a modular, monolithic approach).
- Redis must be used for real-time communication (no alternative messaging layers).

## MODULE 3 – Backend Foundations

### Step-by-step setup:
1. **Initialize NestJS project**:
   - Create a new project: `npx @nestjs/cli new backend --language=ts`.
2. **Set up PostgreSQL connection**:
   - Add `@nestjs/typeorm` and `pg` packages.
   - Configure connection in `app.module.ts`.
3. **Set up Redis connection**:
   - Add `ioredis` package.
   - Create a Redis provider for DI in NestJS.
4. **Implement the authentication module**:
   - Add `@nestjs/jwt` for JWT-based authentication.
   - Include user signup, login, and token generation endpoints.

### Module-by-module build order:
1. `/auth`: Authentication and account management.
2. `/users`: User profiles and interests.
3. `/posts`: Posting and feed management.
4. `/chat`: Real-time messaging.

### Verification steps:
- Run the backend with: `npm run start:dev`.
- Test API endpoints using Postman or cURL.

## MODULE 4 – Frontend Foundations

### Frontend setup and structure:
1. Initialize a Create React App: `npx create-react-app frontend --template typescript`.
2. Install required dependencies:
   - `axios` for API calls.
   - `tailwindcss` for styling.
3. Organize folder structure:
   - `/components`: Reusable UI components.
   - `/screens`: Pages (Signup, Profile, Feeds).

---

## MODULE 5 – Core MVP Features

### Authentication & Accounts:
**Purpose**: Allow users to create and manage accounts.  
**Where it lives**: `/auth` backend module, `/screens/Auth` frontend.  
**Steps**:
1. Implement account signup/login APIs.
2. Create signup/login forms in React.  
**Testing**:
- Verify account creation with correct database records.

## MODULE 6 – Real-Time & Performance Foundations

### Redis Setup:
1. Configure real-time Pub/Sub channels.
2. Integrate Redis with NestJS’s WebSocket Gateway for chat.
---

## MODULE 7 – Security, Privacy & GDPR

### Required security measures:
1. Implement bcrypt for password hashing.
2. Ensure HTTPS-only connections.
3. Add audit logs for all admin actions.

---

## MODULE 8 – Integration & Internal Testing

### End-to-end scenarios:
1. User signup → follow accounts → post → like/comment.

---

## MODULE 9 – Beta Preparation

### Stable features before beta:
- Authentication
- Feeds
- Chat

---

## MODULE 10 – Launch Readiness & Next Steps

### Checklist:
- Confirm all MVP features working.
- Pre-launch bug fixes.

### Deployment steps:
1. Deploy backend and frontend.
2. Set up monitoring tools.
